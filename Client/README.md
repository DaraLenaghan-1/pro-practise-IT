# Mobile Phone Ecommerce Website
This is a simple ecommerce website project built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack. The website allows users to browse and purchase mobile phones.

# Features
Product listings:
Users can view a list of mobile phones and their details, such as the model, brand, and specifications.
Shopping cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart and proceed to checkout.
Checkout: Users can review their order and enter their shipping information to complete their purchase.
Order history: Users can view a history of their past orders.
# How to run the website
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the root directory of the project and install the dependencies by running npm install.
Start the development server by running npm run dev / npm start.
The website should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
# Tech Stack
MongoDB: Used as the database to store product information and customer orders.
Express: Used to handle server-side logic and API routes.
React: Used for the front-end user interface.
Node.js: Used to run the server-side code.

# Week 1 
Had a discussion to plan out our project and what milestones we attend to achieve.
Decided on an ecommerce website for selling phones using MERN stack. 
Created Git hub and notion account for our project where we can make notes and both upload code. 
Had a meeting with our supervisor about our project where we were advised to have the architecture done before we started coding.
We were also advised to have a plan in place so we can reach all our deadlines and not run out of time.  

# Week 2
In week 2 we started coding our app. The code was accidently uploaded to the wrong repo and we found it difficult to push it to the correct one. It took us a few days to get this issue corrected as we were also having trouble with one of our laptops and could not get into it to see the code for a few days. 
We decided with our supervisor to host our web app on a server instead of locally. 

# Week 3
In week 3 we had regained access to our code and had to create a new repo on github with the same code. We also successfully ran our app on codespace the internal cloud server on github and we ran it on gitpod too. We decided to host our app on an Azure server as we could link the server to our github repo.

# Architecture 
MERN is full-stack and it uses a three-tier architectural pattern including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js) and database tier (MongoDB).
React is the top tier of the application and is used for creating dynamic client-side applications in HTML. By using react you can create and build an interface and connect it to the back-end server and render it as HTML. 
Express.js and Node.js work as the server tier. The Express server-side framework runs inside a node.js server. Express matches a URL with a server function and handles HTTP requests and responses. The functions in React can connect to Express and MongoDB and allow the application to work.
MongoDB is the third tier and functions as the database. JSON documents created in React can be sent to the Express server where they are processed and stored directly in MongoDB where they can be retrieved at a later stage.
